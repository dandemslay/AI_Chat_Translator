AI Chat Translator

A small project was created where a chat is generated using an OpenAI token that works only and exclusively with text translation. It was configured in such a way that the chat will only translate what is requested. Although it is a chat with integrated Ai, it was configured to save tokens and translate the texts without providing any other function. 

The application is simple since it is a web app with javascript to generate it in any environment or web integration.
